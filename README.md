# What is Django file Drive ?
It is an API allowing you to manage your own file drive in the cloud. You can see it as a Google Drive API clone.
Here is a list of the main features of the API:
- Mangage users
- Manage files & folders
- Manager who you share your file and folders with
- Search among your files and folders

ðŸ”— Check the [full documentation of the API on Postman.] for more information on all the endpoints.(https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11214441/UVyvvE6f)

ðŸš€ If you want a [live demo](#) of the API, you can check the [front-end repo](https://github.com/Virgin75/file-drive-front) that I created with React.
This API was built with Python and Django Rest Framework.

# How to deploy the project locally?
The easiest way to test the API locally is to run it on your computer.

1. Clone this repo locally
2. `cd` to the directory of the downloaded repo on your device
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory, with the following variable names (mandatory):
``` bash
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=replace-with-anything-you-want
POSTGRES_NAME=choose-your-db-name
POSTGRES_USER=choose-your-db-password
PGUSER=choose-your-db-username
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=choose-your-db-password
ENV=staging
```
4. Use `docker-compose` command to start the server with all the associated services (django app, db, nginx, celery & redis) : `sudo docker-compose up --build`
5. Try to access this URL[http://127.0.0.1/admin/login/](http://127.0.0.1/admin/login/). If you see the Django admin login : the server is up and running ðŸŽ‰
